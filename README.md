# Blender Curve Geometry

![Screen Cap](screenCap.png)

This repository houses Python scripts to create basic 2D geometry in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). At time of writing, this includes

- Bezier Curves:
  1. A Bezier circle that lets you specify the number of knots and their angular offset.
  2. A Bezier arc that lets you specify a start and stop angle. There is a choice between stroke, chord and pie type arc.
  3. A Bezier star.
  4. A [vesica piscis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesica_piscis), the intersection of two circles.
  5. A Bezier egg.

- Meshes:
  1. An arc.
  2. A vesica piscis.

To install, go to Edit > Preferences. Click on Add-ons in the lefthand column. Click on the arrow in the top-right corner. Select Install from Disk in the drop down menu.

These scripts were tested with Blender version 4.4.3.
