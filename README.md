  - A circle with a variable knot count.
  - An egg.
  - A [Reuleaux triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle).
  - A segmented line.
  - A star.
  - A [vesica piscis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesica_piscis), the intersection of two circles.
  
- Meshes:
  - An arc.
  - An egg (2D).
  - A polar grid.
  - A Reuleaux triangle.
  - A star.
  - A vesica piscis.

To install, go to Edit > Preferences. Click on Add-ons in the lefthand column. Click on the arrow in the top-right corner. Select Install from Disk in the drop down menu.

These scripts were tested with Blender version 4.4.3.
