# Blender Curve Geometry

![Screen Cap](screenCap.png)

This repository houses Python scripts to create basic 2D geometry with Bezier curves in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). At time of writing, this includes

1. A Bezier circle that lets you specify the number of knots and their angular offset. The circle defaults to a filled 2D curve.
2. A Bezier arc that lets you specify a start and stop angle. There is a choice between stroke, chord and pie type arc.
3. A Bezier star.
4. A [vesica piscis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesica_piscis), the intersection of two circles.

These scripts were tested with Blender version 4.4.3.
